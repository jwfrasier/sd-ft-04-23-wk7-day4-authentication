# Code Flow Overview

This document provides an overview of the flow of the code and highlights the functions that are called at different stages.

## Initialization

1. Express server is created and listening on the specified port (e.g., 3000).
2. The SequelizeStore is initialized using the Sequelize instance from the models.
3. The SequelizeStore syncs with the database to create the session table.

## Middleware Setup

1. Express session middleware is added to handle session management. It uses the SequelizeStore for session storage and sets the session secret.
2. JSON parsing middleware is added to parse incoming JSON data.
3. URL-encoded parsing middleware is added to parse URL-encoded data.

## Passport Configuration

1. Passport is initialized and session middleware is added to handle user authentication.
2. A new LocalStrategy is created, which defines the logic for authenticating users based on email and password.
3. The LocalStrategy is registered with Passport.

## Authentication Middleware

1. The `authenticate` middleware function is defined.
2. When a route is intercepted, `passport.authenticate` is called with the provided strategy (in this case, "local").
3. Inside `passport.authenticate`, the LocalStrategy's authentication logic is executed.
4. If authentication succeeds, `done(null, user)` is called, where `user` is the authenticated user object.
5. If authentication fails, `done(null, false, {...})` is called, where `{...}` is an optional info object with additional details about the failure.
6. The `authenticate` middleware calls `passport.authenticate`, passing `req`, `res`, and `next` as arguments.

## Route Handlers

1. A POST route handler is defined for the "/sign_up" endpoint.
2. In the "/sign_up" route handler, the email and password are extracted from `req.body`.
3. The password is hashed and a new user is created in the database using the hashed password.
4. A response is sent indicating the successful creation of the user.

5. A POST route handler is defined for the "/login" endpoint.
6. In the "/login" route handler, the `authenticate` middleware is called.
7. If authentication is successful, a response is sent indicating successful login.

8. A POST route handler is defined for the "/delete_secret_information" endpoint.
9. In the "/delete_secret_information" route handler, the `authenticate` middleware is called.
10. If authentication is successful, a response is sent indicating successful deletion.

## Passport Serialization and Deserialization

1. Passport serialization is configured to store the user's ID in the session.
2. Passport deserialization is configured to retrieve the user's data from the database using the stored ID.
