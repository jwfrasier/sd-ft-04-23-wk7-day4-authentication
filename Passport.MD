# Passport Overview

Passport is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to authenticate users using various strategies, such as local username and password, social media logins, or third-party authentication providers. Passport's modular design allows you to mix and match different strategies based on your application's authentication requirements.

Passport works as a middleware layer in your application, allowing you to authenticate requests and manage user sessions. It abstracts the authentication process, making it easier to implement and maintain authentication functionality in your Node.js application.

## Key Concepts

Before understanding the flow of the code, it's essential to be familiar with some key concepts in Passport:

- **Strategies**: Passport implements authentication strategies that define how the user's credentials are verified. Each strategy corresponds to a specific authentication method, such as local, OAuth, or OpenID. Strategies encapsulate the authentication logic and provide a consistent interface for authentication.
- **Sessions**: Passport integrates with session management middleware to store user authentication state across requests. It serializes and deserializes user information to and from the session.
- **Serialize and Deserialize**: Passport provides hooks for serializing and deserializing user objects from the session. Serialization is the process of storing user data in the session, typically the user's ID. Deserialization is the process of retrieving user data from the session based on the stored ID.

## Flow of the Code

Understanding the flow of the code will help you comprehend when the functions, such as LocalStrategy, get called. Here's a breakdown of the code flow:

1. Initialization: The Express server is created, and necessary modules and configurations are set up.
2. Middleware Setup: Session middleware, JSON parsing middleware, and URL-encoded parsing middleware are added to the Express application.
3. Passport Configuration:
   - Passport is initialized and session middleware is added to handle user authentication.
   - A new LocalStrategy is created to authenticate users based on email and password.
   - The LocalStrategy is registered with Passport.
4. Authentication Middleware:
   - The `authenticate` middleware function is defined, which intercepts routes and performs authentication using Passport.
   - Inside `passport.authenticate`, the LocalStrategy's authentication logic is executed.
5. Route Handlers:
   - Route handlers are defined for specific endpoints, such as "/sign_up", "/login", or "/delete_secret_information".
   - In the route handlers, the `authenticate` middleware is called to authenticate user credentials.
   - If authentication is successful, the route handlers proceed with the desired functionality.
6. Passport Serialization and Deserialization:
   - Passport serialization is configured to store the user's ID in the session.
   - Passport deserialization is configured to retrieve the user's data from the database using the stored ID.

It's important to note that the execution of the functions, such as LocalStrategy, occurs when a user attempts to log in or when the route handlers that require authentication are triggered. The LocalStrategy is responsible for verifying user credentials, while Passport manages session-based authentication and user serialization/deserialization.

Remember to customize the authentication logic and error handling based on your application's specific requirements.
