## Setting Up a Simple Node Server with Passport and Session Store

1. Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a new project directory: Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.

3. Initialize a new Node.js project: Run the command `npm init` in your project directory. Follow the prompts to set up a new Node.js project. This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.

4. Install required dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies for your project by running the following commands in your project directory:

   ```shell
   npm install express passport passport-local express-session connect-session-sequelize sequelize bcrypt
   ```

   This will install the Express framework, Passport.js, Passport Local strategy, Express session, Sequelize, and bcrypt.

5. Create the server file: Create a new file, e.g., `server.js`, in your project directory.

6. Set up the basic server: In `server.js`, add the following code to set up a basic Express server:

   ```javascript
   const express = require("express");
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

7. Configure session store: Create a folder named `models` in your project directory. Inside the `models` folder, create a file named `index.js`. In `index.js`, add the following code to configure the session store using Sequelize and connect-session-sequelize:

   ```javascript
   const session = require("express-session");
   const SequelizeStore = require("connect-session-sequelize")(session.Store);
   const { sequelize } = require("../models"); // Adjust the path if necessary

   const sessionStore = new SequelizeStore({
     db: sequelize,
   });

   module.exports = sessionStore;
   ```

8. Configure Passport: In `server.js`, add the following code to configure Passport.js:

   ```javascript
   const passport = require("passport");
   const LocalStrategy = require("passport-local").Strategy;

   // Configure Passport Local strategy
   passport.use(
     new LocalStrategy(async (username, password, done) => {
       // Replace with your authentication logic
       // Find user in the database and verify password
       // Call done() with user object if authenticated, otherwise call done() with false
     })
   );

   // Serialize user for session storage
   passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
     // Serialize user object to store in the session
   });

   // Deserialize user from session storage
   passport.deserializeUser(async (id, done) => {
     // Retrieve user object from the session
   });

   // Initialize Passport and session middleware
   app.use(passport.initialize());
   app.use(passport.session());
   ```

9. Configure Express session: In `server.js`, add the following code to configure the Express session:

   ```javascript
   const session = require("express-session");
   const sessionStore = require("./models"); // Adjust the path if necessary

   app.use(
     session({
       secret: "your-secret-key", // Replace with a secret key for session encryption
       resave: false,
       saveUninitialized: false,

       store: sessionStore,
     })
   );
   ```

10. Create routes for authentication: Define routes for user authentication, such as login, signup, and logout. You can add the following code to `server.js` as an example:

    ```javascript
    app.post("/signup", (req, res) => {
      // Handle user signup logic
    });

    app.post("/login", passport.authenticate("local"), (req, res) => {
      // Handle successful login logic
    });

    app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
      req.logout();
      // Handle logout logic
    });
    ```

    Adjust the routes and their corresponding logic based on your specific requirements.

11. Protect routes with authentication: To protect certain routes that require authentication, use the `ensureAuthenticated` middleware. Add the following code to `server.js`:

    ```javascript
    function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
      if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
      }
      res.redirect("/login"); // Redirect to login page if not authenticated
    }

    app.get("/protected", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
      // Handle protected route logic
    });
    ```

    Adjust the route paths and logic according to your needs.

12. Start the server: Run the command `node server.js` in your project directory to start the server. You should see the message "Server listening on port 3000" in the console.

That's it! You have now set up a simple Node server with Passport.js for user authentication and a session store using Sequelize. You can expand upon this basic setup by adding more features, customizing the authentication process, and connecting to a database for user storage.

Please note that this guide provides a high-level overview of the setup process, and you may need to customize it further based on your specific requirements and project structure.
